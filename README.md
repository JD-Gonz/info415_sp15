    --- Web Application Security ---       

``` 

# Description
This course will cover the ins and outs of web application security from the perspectives of the developer, administrator, and attacker. We will cover attacks from the all too common Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), SQL Injection (SQLi), all the way to more advanced topics such as hash length extension attacks, cookie tossing, deserialization, and specialized vulnerabilities against common web frameworks.
 
The goals of this course center around familiarizing students with how to recognize a possible vulnerability, write a proof-of-concept, and provide helpful remediation so that a developer can properly mitigate the issue. The emphasis will be on hands-on learning and the students will be expected to think creatively as they face common defenses and work with unfamiliar frameworks and languages.
