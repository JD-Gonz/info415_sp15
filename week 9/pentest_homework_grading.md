## Penetration Test (40 points total)
Groups of 3 of you will share environments. I will post who gets which environment in a separate email. Please stick to your own environment and don't mess with each other's work.

## Phase 1 - Initial Discovery (0 points)
You will explore the application and go through the various testing techniques taught in class in order to find the following list of vulnerabilities:

- 3 SQL injections
- 3 XSS
	- 2 stored
	- 1 reflective
- 1 CSRF vulnerability
- 1 information disclosure through an error message
- 1 user enumeration vulnerability
- 1 local file inclusion OR business logic vulnerability

Note: A business logic vulnerability is one that uses existing functionality in a way that allows the user to perform an unintended and malicious action. This does not include any kind of injection, CSRF, Clickjacking, XSS, etc. This is something the attacker would do to "cheat" the application using legitimate functionality that it provides. This is a banking website so look at the banking functionality.

## Phase 2 - The Writeups (40 points)
This is where you will earn all of the points. For each of the vulnerabilities found above you will need to provide the following:

1. A description of the vulnerability. This will usually take the form of: "The Super Secure Bank application suffers from [vulnerability] in the [functionality of the application]. This allows an attacker to [do some bad thing]."
2. Test steps so that a developer with no security knowledge can replicate the exploit and find the vulnerability. These should be clear and include everything they need to reproduce the issue. This means you should put a section just above the test steps that list any tools that will be required to perform the test (e.g. Burp Suite, Firefox, Windows, etc.)
3. Mitigations including a description of what they should do generally to stop this type of vulnerability as well as a link to a resource on how to patch it. The application is written in Java.

## Deliverables
The following is the expected deliverables:

- 10 reports, each with:
	- A description (.5 points)
	- Test steps (3 points)
	- Mitigations (.5 points)

Note: all of the reports should be in one txt file and it should be clear where one report ends and the other begins (e.g. use "----------" to divide reports)

## Due Date
Thursday June 4th 3:30pm (15:30) PST

## Notes & Hints
Make sure your proof that you found the vulnerability is sufficient. This is a test environment so feel free write a simple exploit in order to prove you found it.

Use Burp to intercept the requests and responses from the server. What the server puts in the body of a response and what is actually displayed to a user can differ. Just because you can't see something on the page (like an error message) doesn't mean it's not happening.

Please include links to any pages, guides, tutorials, people, or anything you used to help you figure out these challenges. Please do not cheat or trade answers! If you gently/fairly help one another out make sure to credit the people that helped you in your report. Give credit where credit is due.
